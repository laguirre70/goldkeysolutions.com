                Corporate Bio
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Concierge Assistant has been in use since 1999 at high-end properties such as
                Ritz-Carlton’s, Four Seasons, Hyatt Hotels, Starwood properties, Marriott Hotels
                and other chain and boutique brands. We are also used by a variety of other properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Products has been designed with members and officers of the Les Clefs d’Or organization.
                In addition to the Concierge Desk, guest services staffs and VIP departments also
                use our applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                We enable your staff to spend more time interacting with your guests and focus less
                on the time-consuming paperwork of the desk. Your staff is able to better anticipate
                the needs of your guests by having information that is easily accessible and well
                organized.
            </p>
